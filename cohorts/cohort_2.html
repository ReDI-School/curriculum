    <h2>Introductory Lessons</h2>

    <p> These would be the lessons for students who haven't done coding before, these wouldn't necessarily be applicable
        to all students</p>
    <hr/>

    <h3>Lesson 1 - welcome to your new Ubuntu machine!</h3>
    The intent of this lesson is to make sure that all students are at the same level of computer literacy. It may not
    be appropriate for all groups, particularly those who have done some programming before
    <p>learning outcomes:</p>
    <ul>Student will:
        <li> - understand that this is different to a windows machine, and that the OS is different, what an OS is</li>
        <li> - understand how to install new programs on the machine, demonstration through installing a
            <code>.deb</code> using the gui, and using <code>apt-get</code></li>
        <li> - learn to navigate through the file system using the command line including
            <code>cd</code>,<code>touch</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, <code>rm</code> <code>(-r)</code></li>
        <li>... anything extra needed?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Teachers should be have familiarity with a *nix machine</p>
    <hr/>

    <h3>Lesson 2 - welcome to the internet</h3>
    The intent of this lesson is to get the students to understand basically what the internet does, and have their hand
    in creating it!
    <p>learning outcomes:</p>
    <ul>Student will:
        <li> - understand the server / client model of the internet (i.e. understand what is going on when we make a
            request)
        </li>
        <li> - understand URLs, be encouraged to think critically, about what is likely going on when we use the
            internet (i.e. have some familiarity about web tech stacks?)
        </li>
        <li> - be able to create simple information focussed websites using common tags e.g.<code>h1</code>
            <code>a</code> <code>p</code> <code>div</code></li>
        <li> - understand what the CSS selectors <code>.</code> and <code>#</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lesson 3 - supercharged styling</h3>
    The intent of this lesson is to get the students to be able to express something individualistic and creative. they
    should start to be able to express almost any design intent using CSS.
    They should be able to google their problems, and be encouraged to spend their spare time making their website
    better

    <p>learning outcomes:</p>
    <ul>Student will:
        <li> - start to understand the box model of CSS</li>
        <li> - understand the rules of specificity of css selectors i.e. what <code>div.my-class a</code> means. By this
            point students should be able to select any arbitrary DOM node on the page
        </li>
        <li> - understand how <code>flex</code> works, and how it makes layouting simpler</li>

    </ul>
